# TROOL - a spreadsheet rule engine for NodeJS/TypeScript
<h3>Get rules out of the code so non-engineers can make updates over time!</h3>
<br>


## Features
- Manage rules in a business spreadsheet format.
- Heavily inspired by Java's KnowledgeBase Library.
- Allows use of `Import` objects so values can be reused. These can be passed dynamically through
the code or hardcoded in the spreadsheet.
- GitHub Repo contains fully-functional sample project so you can start practicing right away.
- Fully type-safe :)


## Requirements
- The spreadsheet must be exported as a _.csv_ before usage. 
- Can be used directly with JavaScript (ES5 and ES6) but documentation is in TypeScript.

## Quick Start
- install `$ npm install --save trool`

- Open Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or some other spreadsheet tool of your choice.

- A **Fact** is an instance-object or array of instance-objects, which you want to update based on
conditions that may change over time. Create at least one decision-table on the spreadsheet so you
can update a fact.

- You must follow the format closely for setting up a decision-table. Trool may throw errors if
you do not set things up correctly. The guide contains all the details for setting up a decision-table.
You can look at the screen-shot above if you want a quick glimpse on what decision-tables look like. 

- Export your spreadsheet as a CSV file. The rules for formatting the csv are the same as they are
for the `csvtojson` library. That's what Trool uses internally to convert the csv to a JSON object.

- Create a new NodeJS program (preferably with TypeScript) and import the `trool` library at the top.
Instantiate a new `trool` object and pass `true` to the constructor if you want to show logs while
the library updates your facts.

```typescript
import Trool from 'trool';

class PriceCalculator {

    private trool: Trool;

    constructor() {
        this.trool = new Trool(true);
    }
```

- The trool library only provides 1 public method `applyRules(...)` which returns a promise containing
the updated facts. So create an `async/await` method to fire off `applyRules()` and wrap it in a `try/catch`
block.

- `applyRules(...)` needs the path to the csv file, the facts to be updated, and optionally any imports.

- The facts and the imports must be wrapped in holder objects, with the key being the name of the 
fact/import to use in the spreadsheet, and the value being the actual fact or import. The `imports`
param is optional because you only want to use ones specified in the spreadsheet or have no need for any. 

```typescript
public async calcTotalPrice(): Promise<void> {
    
    const factsHolder = {
        Visitors: [new Visitor(), new Visitor()],
        Tickets: new Ticket()
    }

    const importsHolder = { 
        VisitorTypes: {
            ADULT: 'Adult',
            CHILD: 'Child'
        }
    };

    try {
        const csvFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'Name_of_Spreadsheet.csv');
        const updatedFacts = await this.trool.applyRules(csvFilePath, factsHolder, importsHolder);

    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
    }
}
```

- The `updatedFacts` variable in the previous snippet will contain all the same key/value pairs and
arrays in the same order as the `factsHolder` that was passed in.

## Guide

**Important! When you setup your decision-tables and imports there are some rules to follow the in order 
for your tables/imports to be properly loaded into memory. Strict formatting is enforced for readability 
purposes**.

**Decision-Tables:**

- All decision-tables must start with a cell containing the text `Table: "Fact Name"`. A table without a 
fact name or with a fact name that does not exist on the facts-holder will throw an error. If you create
2 tables that have the same fact-name, the second table will overwrite all the changes from the first.

- A table will end when it reaches an empty row, the end of the file, or the start of a new table
or import. For readability, you should terminate all tables with an empty row.

- The first 2 rows on a decision-table are for specifying the conditions and the actions. If all conditions
are true, then the actions will execute. After the start cell (the cell with `Table: "Fact Name"`) you
must specify at least 1 condition and 1 action.

- Specifying Condition and Action columns must be done by putting `'Condition'` or `'Action'`, at the 
top of each column. These are case sensitive so make sure to capitalize the values. All conditions
must come before all actions and you cannot have anything other than `'Condition'` or `'Action'` at
the top of your table columns. 

- The condition must be a statement which evaluates to `true` or `false`. The left side of the statement 
must be a method or getter on the fact's instance-object and the right side must be `$param`. The operator 
must be an existing JavaScript comparator such as `==` or `<=`. The values in the rows below will replace 
`$param`. For example, suppose I want to get the age of a visitor for an app which calculates ticket prices. I
would need to create a TypeScript getter (`get age(): number {}`) or a method like `getAge() {}` to 
fetch the visitor's age and compare it to the parameter value.

- Actions are methods on a fact which will execute if all the conditions evaluate to true. Unlike conditions,
you can have multiple params passed in. The action must be a method or a TypeScript setter function on
the fact or else Trool will throw an error. The number of params in the action columns' cells below
must match the number or `$param` strings or else Trool will throw an error. 

- All rows on a decision-table, except for the first 2, are referred to as _rules_. A rule works by evaluating 
a list of conditions against cell values which, if they all evaluate to true, will execute the specified 
actions. A rule must start with a rule name and can be anything but cannot be blank.

- For each cell on the rule, if it is a condition column, the cell value will replace the `$param` value
and evaluate the cell as `true` or `false`. An empty cell will automatically be evaluated as `true`. If
any cell evaluates to `false`, that rule will fail and the decision-table will go on the next rule.

- While on a rule's action column, each param specified must be separated by a comma. If no params
are specified (the cell is blank), the rule will skip that action column. 

- Whew that was a lot! Now that we've gone over the rules for creating tables, let's look at an
example in detail. In the following snippet, we see an example on a decision-table and the fact `Tickets`.

<img alt='sampleTable' src='https://github.com/seanpmaxwell/trool/raw/master/sampleTable.png' border='0'>

- To update this fact you needs to make sure the `Tickets` property exists on the facts-holder when it
gets passed to `applyRules()`. If `Tickets` is an array, the decision-table will get applied to each
Ticket instance in the array. 

- The table has one condition and one action. There's also 2 rules: `Set Price - Regular` and `Set Price - Season`. 
Look at the operations for the condition and action. On the left side of each operation 
we can see the properties `option` and `price`. This means that each Ticket instance object passed in must have 
getters/setters for the `option` and `price` properties or else an error will be thrown.

- The first rule `Set Price - Regular` will take the value for `option` and check and see if its value
is equal to the string `"Regular"`. If so, it will apply the action column to the fact. The setter for
`price` will be called and the value `70` will be passed in. The exact same sequence of events will take
place for the next rule `Set Price - Season`. In other words, if the Ticket option is `"Season"`, the price
will be `600`, if the option is `"Regular"`, the price will be `70`.

- And that's how Trool works! If you need to change the price for a Regular or Seasonal ticket over
time without bugging your engineers, just have someone else make updates to the spreadsheet :)

**Imports:**

- For large complicated spreadsheets you might want to reuse certain values. Suppose for Visitors who
might be buying these tickets the maximum age for a child is `18`. One might need to reuse this value
for multiple rules/tables and if it's updated in once place, it needs to be updated everywhere. For 
example, the maximum age for a child might change from `18` to `15` or something like that. This is where
imports come in handy. An import basically sets up a simple JSON object that you can access in your tables.
Imports can be created in the spreadsheet or passed through `applyRules()`. 

- Trool iterates the entire spreadsheet and first looks for all the imports, then it goes back through
and initializes all the decision-tables. So the ordering of your tables/imports does not matter.
For cleanliness I recommend keeping them separated.

- All imports must begin with the cell `Import: "Import Name"`. If you pass an import in the imports holder 
(via `applyRules()`) that has a key matching an import name in the spreadsheet, you will get the warning:
`!!WARNING!! The spreadsheet is using an import name already passed via the imports object. The spreadsheet 
will overwrite the import: "Import Name"`.

- The quick-start had an example of passing imports through `applyRules()`. Let's look at an example of
an import hardcoded in the spreadsheet.
<img alt='importExample' src='https://github.com/seanpmaxwell/trool/raw/master/importExample.png' border='0'>

- With this import, each table will have access to an object named `TicketTypes` and all of its properties.
If you were to place `TicketTypes.SEASON` in a cell for the operation `option == $param`, 
the Ticket object would call the `option` getter and pass `"SEASON"` as the value.

- When using imports through `applyRules()`, you don't have to necessary use an object as a property
and could have it as a primitive. VisitorTypes itself could be a string or number. I don't
recommend using imports this way though; it could be confusing in a collaborative environment.

- One more thing, you cannot use nested properties on imports: i.e. `Import.key.key` This is intentional,
it would lead to a very message spreadsheet. 
<br>


**Special Notes:**

- In Trool spreadsheets, `==` under the hood is actually using `===`. 

- The values you can pass through cells are strings, numbers, true, false, and null. Don't use objects
or undefined. Via imports, you could actually use an object as a `$param` value, but don't do it. This
could be confusing for non-engineers. Stick with primitives. Create extra getters and setters when dealing
with multiple values. 

- Import property name rules are the same as for JavaScript keys. That means alphanumeric, underscores,
and dashes. Anything other than characters will throw an error.

- When recompiling TS parser, make sure you globally install `tspegjs` and use command `tspegjs -o ./lib/FunctionalGrammar.ts --cache ./FunctionalGrammar.pegjs` in ./trool to regenerate the parser.
